// This example demonstrates how events can be created and sent to the pipeline.
// What this example does is scheduling a timeout in a goroutine, and
// sending an EOS message on the bus from there - telling the pipeline
// to shut down. Once that event is processed by everything, the EOS message
// is going to be sent and we catch that one to shut down everything.
//
// GStreamer's bus is an abstraction layer above an arbitrary main loop.
// This makes sure that GStreamer can be used in conjunction with any existing
// other framework (GUI frameworks, mostly) that operate their own main loops.
// Main idea behind the bus is the simplification between the application and
// GStreamer, because GStreamer is heavily threaded underneath.
//
// Any thread can post messages to the bus, which is essentially a thread-safe
// queue of messages to process. When a new message was sent to the bus, it
// will wake up the main loop implementation underneath it (which will then
// process the pending messages from the main loop thread).
//
// An application itself can post messages to the bus aswell.
// This makes it possible, e.g., to schedule an arbitrary piece of code
// to run in the main loop thread - avoiding potential threading issues.
